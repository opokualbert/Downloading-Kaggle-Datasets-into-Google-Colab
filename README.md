Downloading Kaggle Datasets into Google Colab
In this tutorial, I show how to download kaggle datasets into google colab. Kaggle has been and remains the de factor platform to try your hands on data science projects. The platform has huge rich free datasets for machine learning projects. Another product from google, the company behind kaggle is colab, a platform suitable for training machine learning models and deep neural network free of charge without any installation requirement. One key thing that makes colab a game changer, especially for people who do not own GPU laptop is that users have the option to train their models with free GPU. Colab does not have the trove of datasets kaggle host on its platform therefore, it will be nice if you could access the datasets on kaggle from colab. There is in fact a kaggle API which we can use in colab but setting it up to work is not so easy. I would want to show how to use the API in a few simple steps.
